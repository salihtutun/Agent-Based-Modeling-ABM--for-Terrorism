# Agent-Based-Modeling-ABM--for-Terrorism
Understanding the behavior of a terrorist group is a complex phenomenon because of the uncertainty in strategies and tactics used by terrorists. Current literature suggests that terrorism has an evolutionary nature and terrorist groups change behavior according to a government’s counter-terrorism policies. The goal of this research is to model how terrorist groups and government influence each other. In this regards, an agent-based modeling with network topology is used to model the system composed of interacting agents (attacks) and groups. The terrorist groups’ tactics are modeled based on the success rate of attacks and the defense level of a particular location. The proposed model is validated using real-world data of suicide attacks in Iraq. The model can be used to support governmental counterterrorism policy-making.

# Introduction
In recent years, suicide attacks have been increasing because they have a high probability of success. Preventing these
attacks is a significant challenge for governments due to the uncertain tactics and behavior of terrorist groups. Terrorist
groups’ behaviors change dynamically over time and affect individual terrorist behaviors. Therefore, an essential
aspect of studying terrorism is to analyze dynamic organizational behaviors that change over time [1]. A strategic analysis
of terrorist activity is made to understand interactions of terrorist organizations by using non-cooperative game
theory [2]. In addition, a behavioral analysis of terrorist activities is conducted, in order to understand campaigns, by
using a multidimensional Scalogram Analysis technique [3]. Despite this fact, most of the current studies focus on
understanding the relational structure of a terrorist group using network analysis [4]-[7]. These studies provide qualitative
and quantitative results that may be helpful to understand relational structure. However, it is clear that terrorist organizations are complex, and their behavior cannot be fully understood using structural analysis [8]. 

In this regards, Agent Based Modeling (ABM) simulates the changing interactions among agents and can model
emergent collective behaviors. ABM has been shown to be an efficient tool for analyzing evolutionary dynamics
of terrorism networks and interactions [9]. In this study, we simulate events (terrorist attacks) by using ABM with
proposed network topology to understand the behaviors of complex terrorism behaviors. Evolutionary dynamics of
networks and relational structure are used to build the model. At the same time, a defense level of cities by government
after attacks is defined to simulate real system for terrorism.
